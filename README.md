# Java-MineSweeperish
Minesweeper-ish game coded using Java with JavaFX

A very simple version of the classic game Minesweeper. The game begins with a default 20 x 20 board.
The current game utilizes a timer to record speed of loss or victory and a counter for the number of
unmarked bombs. When won or lost, the game will reveal all locations of bombs, color coded to know if
a bomb was marked correctly.
